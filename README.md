## Task
Implement functionality according to design (link in Sources). You can use provided theme or any other theme/scratch project.
### Goals:
 1. Products/variants should be added to cart by clicking the `add to cart` button;
 2. Changing the `product variant (select dropdown)` should correctly change the `variant that will be added to the cart`;
 3. Product cards should be a `carousel on mobile` and a `grid on desktop`;
 4. Clicking the Product Image or Product Title should redirect to PDP (Product Details Page);
## Docs
Shopify CLI: https://shopify.dev/themes/tools/cli
